The time complexity for mini-max-sum is O(2n) because it has two loops (not nested) that iterate the entire input string once, performing constant work each step.

The time complexity for hackerrank-in-a-string, while not recursive, is O(n) because it iterates through the input string only once, performing constant work at each step.
